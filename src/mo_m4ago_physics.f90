!! @brief Module for Marine Aggregates:
!!        The Microstructure, Multiscale, Mechanistic, Marine Aggregates
!!        in the Global Ocean (M4AGO) sinking scheme
!!
!! The mo_m4ago_physics module contains routines to calculate:
!!      - molecular dynamic viscosity
!!
!! See:
!! Maerz et al. 2020: Microstructure and composition of marine aggregates
!!                    as co-determinants for vertical particulate organic
!!                    carbon transfer in the global ocean.
